/**
 * 110. Balanced Binary Tree
 * Easy
 *
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 * Output: true
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
 * Output: false
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: true
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
 * -104 <= Node.val <= 104
 *
 * Binary Tree Overview
 * A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, called the left child and right child.
 * The topmost node is called the root.
 *
 * Balanced Binary Tree
 * A binary tree is height-balanced if:
 *
 * The depths of the two subtrees of every node differ by at most 1
 * Both left and right subtrees are also balanced
 *
 * How to Check if Binary Tree is Balanced
 *  The algorithm uses DFS to compute heights and check balance simultaneously:
 *  Base case: Empty tree is balanced (height = 0)
 *  Recursive case: For each node, check if left and right subtrees are balanced
 *  Height difference: Ensure |leftHeight - rightHeight| â‰¤ 1
 *  Early termination: Return -1 if subtree is unbalanced
